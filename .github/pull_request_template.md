## Hints

* name your branches accordingly: use the prefixes `bugfix/`, `feature/`, or `release/` and then a short title for your PR in kebab-case (lowercase words separated with dashes), e.g. `feature/my-awesome-feature`.
* Please make sure that [pre-commit hooks](https://github.com/at-gmbh/personio-py#contributing) are enabled on your system to avoid common mistakes before you make a commit.
* feel free to delete this template and replace it with your own description of the PR.
